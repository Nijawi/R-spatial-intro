# R for mapping and more

This repository contains notes and code on many of the things I wish I had known about spatial data and R when I first started.

Hit the green 'code' button in the top right to download a .zip with a .html file you can double-click to read the notes and use the code. Download the data [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5uf8994chag6qce/AABnY9OmKeyTkNa-9e50c0FNa?dl=0).
