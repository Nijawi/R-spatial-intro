# R for mapping and more

This repository contains notes and code on many of the things I wish I had known about spatial data and R when I first started.

There are two parts:

1.  **R for mapping and more** This provides an overview of the following:

 - Overview of what spatial data is, with links to more in-depth resources
 - Overview of R packages available for spatial data
 - How to start a spatial project in R
 - How to wrangle spatial data in R
 - How to perform spatial operations in R
 - How to make a map in R
 - Common problems you might encounter in R spatial, and how to solve them

Check out the tutorial [here](https://cabuelow.quarto.pub/r-for-mapping-and-more/) and if you want to run through the code yourself, download the data [here]((https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5uf8994chag6qce/AABnY9OmKeyTkNa-9e50c0FNa?dl=0))

2. **Calculating areas with vector and raster data** This provides some insight into how best to calculate area in R. A link to the published version of the blog is here:
